# CountDown-Project-Basic-JS
this is a basic Count Down project of JavaScript 

in line num 45 timer.js - there is a line console.log("I am running") was just to make sure that my setInterval is working peoperly or not.
nd this line is working on the console so don't worry about that.
yo can delet the line nu 45 in timer.js if you want to nothing will affect the result .
